# MobileApp
This repository is for my class Mobile Application Development. 
It contains all of my files for the site I created based on my favorite books and movies. 
On both the favorite books and movies pages user can interact with the site by entering 
their favorite movies/books and any recommendations they have.
The homepage is a little about me section that contains pictures as well as a panel that's used for navigsting between the pages.
The pages are all based in HTML with the CSS being handled on the HTML pages and with the theme I created with ThemeRoller.
